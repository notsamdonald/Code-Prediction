PAST todo:

- Modify HW3 Q3 to work with my dataset
- Move to colab
- Get Arc working (?)
	- Probably can just afford to wait untill next week

- Determine method of curating dataset such that PASTs can be generated along with target
	- This (probably) needs to be done preprocessing vs inside the training
		
- Determine method to linearize the past
	- https://github.com/zhangj111/astnn

- Configure CodeBert to work with multiple inputs (see reference with using docstring and code together)
	- Done think this is major

- Train!
	
- Think about extensions:
	- At this point everything is just tweaks
	- Two CodeBerts(?) with a linear combination fusion layer
	- DeepOnet (?)
		- Wild yet would be a simple extension above the linear fusion
	- Separate model specifically for AST?
