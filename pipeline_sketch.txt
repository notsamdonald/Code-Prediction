Pipeline:

* = todo

code -> split -> ast -> graph -> ast_tokenizer -> GAE * -> linearized AST * = ast input *

graphs -> all words -> train tokenizer -> ast_tokenizer * 

split * -> codebert tokenizer -> code input *

code input * + ast input * -> codeBert finetune *-> split target *
	- also need to figure out if both can be passed into bert
	- or just going to have to go with a FCC layer
		- if so, how to deal with the dynamic size? padding?
